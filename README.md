# MITxPRO-eye

In JavaScript, events are actions that happen on a web page. They can be anything from a mouse moving to a user typing in some text. Events happen to most elements on the DOM. These events are a good way to bind a code to user actions. For example, consider a web page that has a form with a "Submit" button. You can bind the mouse button click to that button and submit the form data upon that click.

## Task 1

Add a second "eye" element, and have that element follow the mouse position on the screen using mouse events

## Task 2

Make sure you are implementing your for () loop with the correct format & styling

## How to run

Open index.html in the browser.

## Future improvements

- Draw a face around the eyes.
- Change eye color every time you click.
- Write tests for helper functions.
